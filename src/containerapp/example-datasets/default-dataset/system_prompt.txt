Extract all data from the document in a comprehensive and structured manner. 

Focus on:
- Key identifiers (invoice numbers, reference numbers, IDs)
- Financial information (amounts, totals, currency, taxes)
- Parties involved (vendors, customers, suppliers, recipients)
- Dates and timelines (invoice dates, due dates, service periods)
- Line items and details (products, services, quantities, prices)
- Contact information (addresses, phone numbers, emails)
- Any other relevant structured data visible in the document

When both text and images are available, use the text as the primary source and cross-reference with images for accuracy. When only images are available, extract all visible information directly from the visual content.
